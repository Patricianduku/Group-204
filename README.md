## Project Structure

The project consists of a single HTML file (`index.html`) with embedded CSS styles.

-   `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the portfolio and inline CSS.

## Getting Started

1.  **Download the HTML:** Save the provided HTML code as `index.html`.
2.  **Open in Browser:** Open `index.html` in your web browser.

## Customization

You'll need to customize the content and images to personalize your portfolio.

1.  **Replace Placeholder Text:** Update the placeholder text (`[Your Name]`, `[Your About Me Paragraph]`, etc.) with your own information.
2.  **Add Your Profile Picture:** Replace `"your-profile-picture.jpg"` with the path to your profile picture.
3.  **Add Project Images:** Replace `"project1.jpg"`, `"project2.jpg"`, etc., with the paths to your project images.
4.  **Add Your CV:** Place your CV file (PDF) in the same directory as `index.html` and name it `your-cv.pdf`.
5.  **Customize Programming Languages, Education, and Interests:** Fill in the details in the respective sections.

## Sections

The portfolio is divided into the following sections:

-   **Home:** Introduces you with your name and a brief description.
-   **About:** Provides a brief introduction about yourself and your passion.
-   **Programming Languages:** Lists the programming languages you are proficient in.
-   **Educational Background:** Details your education and includes a download link to your CV.
-   **Interests:** Shares your interests in technology and your professional interests.
-   **Projects:** Displays your projects with images and descriptions.
-   **Contact:** Includes a contact form for visitors to reach you.

## Responsiveness

The website is designed to be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.

-   **Mobile Navigation:** The navigation menu collapses into a burger icon on smaller screens, and expands when the burger is clicked or focused.
-   **Project Grid:** The project grid adapts to smaller screens by adjusting the number of columns.
-   **Hero Section:** The hero section stacks the content and image vertically on smaller screens.

## Contact Form

The contact form allows visitors to send you messages.

-   **HTML Form:** The form uses HTML `form` elements with `input` and `textarea` fields.
-   **No Backend:** The form currently doesn't have a backend to process the messages. You'll need to add server-side code or use a form submission service to handle the data.

## Download CV

The education section includes a download link for your CV.

-   **HTML Anchor Tag:** The link uses an HTML `a` tag with the `download` attribute.
-   **File Placement:** Ensure your CV file is named `your-cv.pdf` and located in the same directory as `index.html`.

## Future Improvements

-   **Add a Backend:** Implement a backend for the contact form to process and send messages.
-   **Improve Styling:** Enhance the CSS styles for a more polished look.
-   **Add More Projects:** Include more projects with detailed descriptions and images.
-   **Add a Gallery:** Include a picture gallery.
-   **Add More Social Media Links:** Add links to your social media profiles.
-   **Add a footer:** add a footer.
-   **Use external CSS:** Extract the CSS into a separate file for better organization.
-   **Add Javascript:** Add javascript for additional functionality.
